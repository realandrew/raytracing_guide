# Raytracing Guide

Raytracing Guide is a website featuring Raytracing and other graphics content written by Andrew Mitchell.

It's freely available under the MIT license.

Created with [VitePress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/).

Note: This is mostly a placeholder for now. My main effort is in finishing my [Vulkan Guide](https://vulkanguide.com/).
